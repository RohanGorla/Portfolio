            Hello, I am Rohan. I'm a self taught web developer with a passion to
            build cool  and unique websites. I've been learning web development from since
            November, 2023 and have been improving and refining my skills to
            make better websites. I'm always on the search for new things i can
            build, which will challenge my current knowledge and improve my
            skill set at the same time. Currently I'm looking for my first
            full-time job and start my career in Web development.

          <p>
            I might not have a degree in Computer Science, but i have just as
            much passion and desire to get into Web development as someone with
            a degree. The software industry is growing rapidly, new technologies
            are being introduced every day and I know it's challenging to stay
            updated with the current trends. But I do believe that with my
            skills & abilities and an easily trainable mindset, I can perform to
            the best of my abilities to learn new things quickly and produce
            desirable outcomes. I am open-minded towards constructive feedback.
            I want to become a team player and dedicate all my skills and
            talents to develop high-quality and unique websites.
